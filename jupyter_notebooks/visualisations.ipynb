        "In this notebook, I will explore and communicate key trends in global video game sales to validate my hypotheses about what drives sales performance.  \n",
        "I will begin with an overview of **global sales trends**, then create targeted visualisations to test each hypothesis — such as the impact of reviews, regional platform strength, and the effect of multi-platform and first-party releases.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Inputs\n",
        "I will use the **processed datasets** created during ETL and feature engineering:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `video_game_sales_cleaned.csv` — base cleaned dataset with essential sales and metadata.\n",
        "- `video_game_sales_critic_review.csv` — games with valid critic reviews.\n",
        "- `video_game_sales_user_review.csv` — games with valid user reviews.\n",
        "- `video_game_sales_merged.csv` — aggregated game-level dataset (platforms merged).\n",
        "- `video_game_sales_first_party.csv` — dataset with engineered `is_first_party` and `is_multiplatform` columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Outputs\n",
        "- Visualisations that support each hypothesis:\n",
        "  - **Global sales trends** over time.\n",
        "  - Impact of **critic reviews** on sales.\n",
        "  - Impact of **user reviews** on sales.\n",
        "  - **Platform strength by region** (Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, Other).\n",
        "  - **Multi-platform vs single-platform** sales comparison.\n",
        "  - **First-party vs third-party** sales comparison.\n",
        "- Charts and summaries for the final Tableau dashboard.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Approach\n",
        "Each visualisation ties directly to one of my hypotheses and Kanban board user stories.  \n",
        "I will start with a **Global Sales Trend** plot to establish market context, then move into deeper hypothesis testing using the processed datasets."
